:mod:`divina` is an open source, BSD3-licensed library providing scalable and hyper-interpretable causal forecasting capabilities written in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ and consumable either via Bash CLI or the built-in web-app.
programming language.

The aim of :mod:`divina` is twofold:

1) to reduce the complexity of configuration for causal forecasting at scale. this is accomplished by abstracting all configuration to a single JSON file that lets users configure new experiments easily and safely. Below is an example forecast definition.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "vision_definition": {
            "time_index": "index",
            "target": "passengers",
            "time_validation_splits": ["1957-01-01"],
            "time_validation_horizons": [1],
            "dataset_directory": "s3://divina-public/dataset/airline_sales",
        }
    }

2) to deliver scalable and bidirectionally interpretable models that bring transparency and incremental control to the forecasting process. This is done using a variety of coefficient calculation tools for highly-parametric and non-parametric models, binning and interacting of features and and a set of interfaces allowing users to override individual model and forecast coefficients with domain knowledge.

In a minimal example, divina can be used to create a weather forecast using the below command and forecast definition

.. code-block:: bash

    divina forecast forecast_definition.json --local


and will produce a local output structure as shown below::

    divina-forecast
      |- models
      |    |
      |    \- insample
      |         |
      |         \- model.joblib
      |- predictions
      |      |
      |      \- insample
      |           |
      |           \- predictions_partition_0.parquet
      \- validation
             |
             \- insample
                  |
                  \- metrics.json

In a more advanced configuration, divina can be used with the following command and forecast definition

to produce an s3 hosted output structure as shown below

###TODO - illustrate use of start date, end date and horizon to deliver "best information" forecast
