:mod:`divina` is an open source, BSD3-licensed library providing scalable and hyper-interpretable causal forecasting capabilities written in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ and consumable via CLI.

The aim of :mod:`divina` is twofold:

1) **to reduce the complexity of configuration for causal forecasting at scale.** This is accomplished by abstracting all configuration to a single JSON file that lets users configure new experiments easily and safely.

2) **to deliver scalable and bidirectionally interpretable causal forcasting models.** These models bring transparency and incremental control to the forecasting process using a variety of coefficient calculation tools, binning and interacting of features and set of link functions that enable a linear model to fit various target distributions.

**Experiment Persistence**

Experiment artifacts are persisted either locally or to S3 depending on the use of the `--local` flag when running the experiment command and will produce a local output structure as shown below::
